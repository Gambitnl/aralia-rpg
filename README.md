# Aralia RPG

Aralia is a small demo roleâ€‘playing project. The repository mixes a simple browser UI, an API handler for Vercel, and some Python game logic modeled after Dungeons & Dragons. Both JavaScript and Python tests are included.

## Setup

Install Node dependencies first:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs Jest and any other packages declared in `package.json`.

## Running Tests

### JavaScript

Run the Jest suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

### Python

All Python tests are compatible with pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

Both suites should pass without additional configuration.

## Deployment

The `api/` directory contains serverless functions designed for Vercel. After installing the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) you can deploy with:

```bash
vercel
```

Make sure to set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your Vercel project settings so that `/api/gemini.js` can call the Gemini API correctly.
