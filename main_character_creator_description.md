The `main_character_creator.py` file originally provided a text-driven workflow for building a character.  The
interactive prompts have since been removed.  Today the module exposes a
single helper, `create_character()`, which returns a minimal `CharacterState`
instance without any console input.

Historically the function guided the user through a sequence of steps:

1.  **Initialization**: It begins by setting up the necessary components:
    *   An instance of `DataManagementModule` is created to load and provide access to all predefined game data (species, classes, etc.).
    *   A `CharacterState` object is initialized to hold all the character's information as it's being built.
    *   A `RulesEngine` is instantiated, armed with the `DataManagementModule`, to handle game logic and validation.

2.  **Species Selection**: The user is prompted to choose a species for their character.
3.  **Class Selection**: Following species selection, the user selects a class.
4.  **Ability Score Assignment**: The script then moves to assigning ability scores. The primary method implemented is `assign_stats_point_buy`, which allows users to allocate points to their character's abilities according to D&D's point buy rules.
5.  **Subclass Selection**: If the chosen class has subclasses available at 1st level (or the relevant starting level being implemented), the `select_subclass` function is called to allow the user to pick a specialization. This step is conditional based on the class features.

Throughout this process, `main_character_creator.py` demonstrates clear interaction with the other architectural layers:

*   It heavily relies on `DataManagementModule` to fetch and display options to the user, such as retrieving a list of available species, classes, or details about them.
*   As the user makes choices, the `CharacterState` object is progressively updated to reflect these selections (e.g., storing the chosen species, class, and assigned ability scores).
*   The `RulesEngine` is utilized for crucial tasks like validating the legality of point buy ability score distributions and for calculating and displaying final ability scores along with their modifiers.

In the removed CLI version, user interaction was handled through helper
functions such as `display_options()` and `get_user_choice()` which worked with
console input.  These helpers are no longer used.

A notable feature for development and testing is the try-except block around the import of the core logic modules (`DataManagementModule`, `CharacterState`, `RulesEngine`). If these primary modules are not found (e.g., during early UI development or for isolated testing of the main script's flow), it attempts to load dummy versions (`DummyDataManagementModule`, `DummyCharacterState`, `DummyRulesEngine`). This fallback mechanism allows the main script to run and test the user interaction flow even without the full backend logic being present or functional.

Upon completion of all steps, the script typically concludes by printing a summary of the created character, showcasing the choices made and key calculated statistics.

Finally, the script uses the standard Python `main()` function and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to define the entry point for execution, ensuring that `create_character()` is called when the script is run directly.
